This project is a hands-on implementation of the concepts taught in Stanford University's iOS Development with SwiftUI course. It covers the fundamentals of SwiftUI by building a Memory Game App.

## Concepts Used:
- SwiftUI Views (VStack, ScrollView, LazyVGrid)
- MVVM Architecture (MemoryGameViewModel, MemoryGameModel)
- State Management with @ObservedObject
- Dynamic Grid Layout with LazyVGrid
- Custom Views (CardView)
- Animations and UI Components

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Understand the MVVM architecture in SwiftUI
- Explore State Management with property wrappers like @ObservedObject
- Implement custom UI components using SwiftUI
- Gain hands-on experience with adaptive grid layouts

## Course Reference
This project follows along with Stanford University's CS193p iOS Development with SwiftUI course:
